Netflix says account is already in use
If you get the error code E123 or any of these messages when you play a TV show or movie:

Too many people are using your account right now.

Your Netflix account is in use on another device.

Your Netflix account is in use on too many devices.

It means the maximum number of devices allowed to watch at the same time using your Netflix account has been reached. Your Netflix plan determines how many devices are allowed to watch at the same time using your account.

To fix the problem:

On a different device using your account, stop playing Netflix or close the Netflix app. If you don't know which devices on your account might be playing Netflix at the same time, you can check which devices recently watched.

Note:After stopping Netflix on a different device, you may need to wait 5-10 minutes before you can watch on your device.

Or, upgrade your Netflix plan to allow more devices to watch at the same time (up to 4 with the Premium plan).

If your Netflix account is being used without permission, you can stop someone from using your account.
