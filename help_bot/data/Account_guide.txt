How to change your plan
You can change your Netflix plan by following these steps:

Go to the Change Plan page in a browser. You may need to sign in if you haven't already.

Choose the plan you'd like, then select Continue or Update.

If you don't have the option to change your plan, see "Can't change plan" below.

Tap or click Confirm Change or Confirm.

Changing to a higher-priced plan takes effect immediately so you can enjoy all of the added features. Your billing date may change based on the remaining balance of your last payment, or you may be charged a prorated amount for the balance.

Changing to a lower-priced plan takes effect on your next billing date. You can continue to use the features of the higher-priced plan until then.

Note: If you have Netflix through a partner package or package add-on, search our Help Center for the article on your partner to find details on plan change timing and eligibility.
