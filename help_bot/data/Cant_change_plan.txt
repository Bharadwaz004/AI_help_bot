Can't change plan

If you arenâ€™t able to change your plan, it could be for a number of reasons:

Account is on hold

Account is paused

A Kids profile is active whe"n you go to the Change Plan page. See How to switch profiles to change to a different one.

You changed to a lower-priced plan this billing period. (You'll need to wait until the next billing period to make another plan change.)

Note: If you pay for Netflix through a partner or get Netflix as part of a package you may not have the option to change your plan.
